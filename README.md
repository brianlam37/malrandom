## Background

I made this application because I was frustrated with a long plan to read list on MyAnimeList, I didn't know where to start.
<br />
Sure I could have started at the top of the list but that's boring, and finding out the date the series was added to the list was tedious.
<br />
So I opted for a random solution, where I simply used a random number generator from one to the max number of series.
<br />
After being annoyed of having to adjust the total number every time I completed a series on the random number generator,
or having to look up the list again to find the total number, I decided I was just going to make a web application.
