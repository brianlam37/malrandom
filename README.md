## Background

Frustrated with a long plan to read list on MyAnimeList, I didn't know where to start. Sure I could have started at the top of the list but that's boring, and finding out the date the series was added to the list was tedious. So I opted for a random solution, where I simply used a random number generator from one to the max number of series. After being annoyed of having to adjust the total number every time I completed a series on the random number generator, or having to look up the list again to find the total number, I decided I was just going to make a web application.
